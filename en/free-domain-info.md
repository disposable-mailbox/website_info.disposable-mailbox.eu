## Info on the free domains used

This service is provided for test purposes and free of charge, there is no guarantee of constant availability, in particular not for the usability of the domains.
 
With the exception of free.disposabl.email, we use the free domains of the provider Freenom for the mailboxes.
 
In the case of free domains, the provider reserves the right in the terms and conditions to deactivate domains, transfer them to other customers, activate and deactivate their own content and make other changes at their own discretion.  The provider also makes use of this right, so that the mailboxes cannot be used over the long term.  On the one hand, this has the advantage that the domains do not end up in blacklists as often due to the rotation, but also the disadvantage that mail delivery is not possible permanently - so do not use the addresses for permanent applications such as customer accounts (please also note the information on  Public visibility of the mails).
 
The domains disposable-mailbox.eu and disposabl.email are fixed domains for the website (disposable-mailbox.eu, however, not activated for receiving mail) and there are no plans to switch them off.
