## WHY DO YOU USE DISPOSABLE EMAIL / TRASHMAIL ADDRESSES?

Disposable email addresses are very popular on the web.  For some, such e-mail addresses are a blessing, for others a curse!

## WHAT ARE DISPOSABLE EMAIL ADDRESSES?

Disposable e-mail addresses are temporary e-mail addresses for which you generally do not need a registration and which do not have to be created in advance, as they already exist.
The permanent existence of such disposable addresses for a certain domain is realized via a catch-all address, which accepts all emails sent to a domain, regardless of the local part or email alias (username@disposable-e.ml)  the email address looks like.

Disposable email addresses are often also referred to as TrashMail addresses, fake email addresses or one-time email addresses.

As a rule, the received emails are only saved temporarily for a certain period of time before they are irrevocably deleted.
The retention period varies from provider to provider; with disposable-mailbox.eu it is currently 24 days.

The accounts used for the TrashMail addresses do not need to be deleted by the user, since all associated data, as already ...

## WHEN DO YOU USE DISPOSABLE EMAIL ADDRESSES AND WHEN NOT?

Disposable email addresses are usually used when you have your private email address, e.g.  B. during a registration, because the provider is unknown or does not appear to be sufficiently trustworthy.
Because with such providers there is a high risk that you will then receive unwanted newsletters or spam emails.

TrashMail addresses should only be used for private purposes - never professionally or commercially, as security against unauthorized access is usually not sufficiently guaranteed.
disposable-mailbox (.eu) offers e.g.  B. * no * password protection for disposable addresses, only the generation of hash-like email addresses,
but in the end the user himself decides how he uses such services and is therefore responsible for the security of his data / emails.

## DO TRASHMAIL ADDRESSES ALWAYS WORK?
No!
One of the biggest problems with disposable email addresses is that there are numerous blacklists on the web listing all known domains of TrashMail providers.
This is where disposable-mailbox comes into play as a self-hosted service, because you can install the service on your own server and use it with your own domain / s.
As a self-hosted mailbox, you also have the option to protect access from unauthorized persons (web server / htaccess - password protection or you write a little in the code yourself, but note that your changes can be lost if you update from GitHub - or you develop right away  on GitHub and lets everyone share your knowledge and benefit from further [development](https://github.com/pfeifferch/disposable-mailbox);))
