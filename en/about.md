### THATS HOW IT WORKS

Possible initial situation:
 You will be asked to enter your email address on an unknown website.
Question:
 What is happening to this one?  Resale, spam or newsletter?
Now disposable-mailbox.eu comes into play!

1. Think of an email address in connection with one of the available domains
   For example: something@zaun.ml .
2. Retrieve mailbox & read email
3. Done
That's it.  Easy right?

> Tip:
> Do you have your own unused domain?
> Then use it for your own disposable mailbox...


If you no longer need this disposable email address, just forget about it!
You do not have to cancel or delete this email address,
At most you should delete the emails you have received if they contain personal information.

Of course, existing emails are also automatically deleted after 24 days.
